  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A Caesar salad (also spelled Cesar and Cesare) is a green salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with lemon juice (or lime juice), olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic, Dijon mustard, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 French Baguette, cut in hald and thinly sliced (1/4" thick)</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp <i>extra virgin olive oil</i></li>
    <li>1 tsp minced garlic, 2 small cloves</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 small garlic cloves, minced (1 tsp)</li>
    <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>2 tsp fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp sea salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp black pepper, plus more to serve</li>
    <li>1 large romaine lettuce, (or 2 small heads romaine)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup parmesan cheese, shredded or shaved</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Cut the baguette in half lengthwise through the top of the baguette then slice diagonally into 1/4" thick pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizzle the garlic oil over the croutons and sprinkle the top with 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350˚F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
    <li>Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.</li>
    <li>Whisk in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper, or season to taste.</li>
    <li>Rinse, dry and chop or tear the romaine into bite-sized pieces. Place in a large serving bowl and sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese and cooled croutons. Drizzle with caesar dressing and toss gently until lettuce is evenly coated.</li>
