Recipe website project

This website has 4 webpages:
- index.html (which is the homepage)
- banana-bread.html, carrot-cake-cupcakes.html and ceasar-salad.html (which are recipe web pages)

In the index page, there are all the links button to get to the recipe web pages. Also did everything as the assignment told me to do. In addition to this, i used many different html elements to show my skills such as: headings (h1, h2, ...), links (a), images (img), paragraphs (p) and so on...

The recipe informations came from various sources: Wikipedia, allrecipes.com and other recipes websites.
